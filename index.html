            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            <big>
                I am a 16 year old <span style="color: blue">Python Developer, Prompt Engineer, Electrical Hobist and Photographer</span>. 
                I have used <span style="color: blue">Mac, Linux and Windows</span>. I can do simple task and nagvigation and at least write some type of Python code on all 3 operating systems .
                I have used <span style="color: blue;">Raspberry Pi's, Arduino's and ESP32/ESP8266</span> for a long time and know many basics.
                <br><br>My main projects on a Raspberry Pi 5 is Hana-Chan AI on it. Hana-Chan AI is powered with an LLM that runs on the Raspberry Pi.
                The Raspberry Pi is connected to a smart visor I made, you can talk to Hana using your voice and she will reply in text and shown in the visor.
                <br><br>I play around with Python programming since I was 13 years old. 
                My main projects are Penguino, Hana-Chan and Shelly. 
                Penguino and Hana-Chan are Discord bots who does modderation, simple chatting and have a personality.
                However both of them are discontinued. 
                My current main project is Shelly who is an AI telegram chatbot, Shelly can reply in different personalities, send images and have long term memory.
                <br><br>I started playing around with Arduino's when I was 15. I have never really understood electrical engineering but I have
                learned my ways to use an Arduino and other microcontrollers to make cool projects.
                My side projects include a cctv, glowing red creepy eyes, motion detection sound player (like a doorbell).
                My main projects include an Axe with lightning effects and a sword with IRL sound effects.
                <br><br>I started photography when I was 15, using a Sony A6400 with the kit lens and a 70-300mm lens to take wild life and landscape.
                Currently trying to be more comfortable with taking human subjects.

            My Selfmade Axe
        </h2>
        <p>
            My DIY Axe was made in October 2022 for a haloween event. It shows off an Arduino UNO on the side of it and is powered by a powerbank.
            The Axe will flash blue led lights in a electricity style effect. It can be activated by sudden motion or sudden contact with an object.
